In this week, I completed the assignment by create a well-structured HTML5 document and linked it to a simple JavaScript that:
      - Changes text content dynamically.
      - Modifies CSS styles via JavaScript.
      - Adds or removes an element when a button is clicked
index.html

    Contains a well-structured HTML5 document with:

        A header and footer

        A description paragraph

        An input field for entering new items

Buttons:
      - Change Content
       - Add Item — adds a new item to the list
       - Remove Selected Item — removes the currently selected item

A list section of items that are dynamically displayed

In the style.css 
       - The page contents change dynamically >> Modifies header text and description on page load
       - Adds items to a list when the Add Item button is clicked. One item is a added a time.
       - Clicking a list item highlights it by adding a selected CSS class
       - Only one item can be selected at a time for removal/addition.

Skills demonstrated:
            DOM Selection (getElementById, createElement, appendChild, remove)
            Event Handling (click events)
